# MemesUploader
i was scrolling through youtube and found a [hollow knight meme compilation video](https://youtu.be/2YiZtwzOR3Q) and realised that this entire process could be automated -  
* get top 100 posts from past week from some meme subreddit  
* make a video out of these images using ffmpeg  
* slap some copyright free music on  
* upload the video using youtube api  
* profit
  
i realised later on that this isnt revolutionary and that it's been done before, so im just gonna put my code out here since its not like it's actually gonna turn into profit in any way.  
i still liked making this and working with ffmpeg and stuff and i plan on finishing it even though im not gonna use it  
  
# todo
* i'm left with the whole youtube api part, and the video making bugs out at times so im planning on fixing that too.  
* i also have plans on making a 'video memes' compilation version which, instead of combiing a bunch of static image memes, combines a bunch of video memes.  this is a WIP.
